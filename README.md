# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on the one you select. It uses a content-based filtering approach with data from the TMDB 5000 movie dataset. The system analyzes movie features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords to find related movies. The backend is built using Python and Streamlit, and you can run it locally to get movie suggestions in your browser. It's a simple project to understand how recommendation systems work using real-world data.
